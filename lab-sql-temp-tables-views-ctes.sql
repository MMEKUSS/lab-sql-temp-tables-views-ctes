-- Ejercicio1 Create a View
-- First, create a view that summarizes rental information for each customer. 
-- The view should include the customer's ID, name, email address, and total number of rentals (rental_count).
CREATE VIEW customer_rental_summary AS
SELECT
    customer.customer_id,

-- Ejercicio 2Create a Temporary Table
-- Next, create a Temporary Table that calculates the total amount paid by each customer (total_paid). 
-- The Temporary Table should use the rental summary view created in Step 1 to join with the payment table and calculate the total amount paid by each customer.
